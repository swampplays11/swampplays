# Adapt

This guide will show you how to adapt the 2PG dashboard, for your own bot code.

### Requirements

Make sure you have followed the local [setup guide](setup/) for 2PG, and have the two projects working correctly. 

{% page-ref page="setup/" %}

```

```

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't need to fill in `.env`, as you will be using your own bot code for this tutorial.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
