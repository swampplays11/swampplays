## Challenge - Make a Clean Command

### Test your knowledge and make a clean command.

**Purpose**: Organize Downloads and Pictures folders to prevent them from getting messy.  
**It Should**: Delete all files in Downloads, and move all screenshots into Pictures/screenshots.  
**Hint**: you should use the \* wildcard.

* [ ] Command should be on one line.
* [ ] Downloads and Pictures should be in the default directory \(**`~`**\).
* [ ] In this context, screenshots are any file that starts with 'Screenshot' 
  * Screenshots are created in Ubuntu 20.04 when you press **`prt sc`**.

## Challenge - Make a Today Command

### Test your knowledge and make a today / reminder command.

**Purpose**: Write quick reminders for today, in folders that are organized by date.  
**It Should**: Create a .txt file in a path with a special format, then open it with a text editor.

  * [ ] **ww** is the week number.
  * [ ] **dd** is the day number.

* [ ] Then open the file with a text editor \(i.e. Nano\).
{% endhint %}

## Challenge - Make a Trash Command

{% hint style="success" %}
### Test your knowledge and make a trash / recycle bin script.

**It Should**: Move a file to a trash folder, then append log of filename, and timestamp to a file.
